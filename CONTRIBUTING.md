# Contributing

Feel free to contribute in any way you want. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are all welcome. I'll do my best to respond and act on them as quick as possible.

## Submitting changes

- Fork the repository.
- Push your changes to a feature branch in your repository.

Please make sure you run `npm run lint` before you submit the pull request as pipelines will fail otherwise.
